Last November, [Shreyash](/shreyashpatodia) and I decided to start a blog. It wasn't planned - it was just a spur of the moment thing. We had a *lot* of different ideas about what it should be like - the name, the content, the design, even the logo. But we agreed on one major issue - it had to reflect us and what we were going to do.

We ultimately chose the name reifycode because that encapsulates one of our major goals - to transform our abstract thoughts into concrete implementations. To make a bunch of commands come alive on the screen. To reify our code.
