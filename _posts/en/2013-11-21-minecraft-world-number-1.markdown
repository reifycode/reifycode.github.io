*Minecraft is the only game I play. No kidding, the only one. I've been playing on a few single-player worlds by now. With the 1.7 release that came out just recently, bringing with it a whole new terrain generation, I started from scratch, and set up a small white-listed server to play around with my friends. Let's have a tour, you are my guest.*

I chose the Mega Taiga biome. This one gives a great feeling… hiding under these huge trees, its colors are calm and warmy at the same time. I stumbled upon a hobbit hole home idea on reddit someday, there I had some inspiration for this one.  
Come inside, don't be shy.

To stay in a *cozy* mood, I played a lot with these new darker wood planks, in association with some shy stained clay on the walls.

This is my main room. **On the right** stand my bed and my automatic melon farm, along with a good looking map. **On the left** are all my storage chests, some furnaces, and a 30-level-ready enchanting area (which can't be seen on this specific screenshot, imagine it on the extreme left, right before the first column of chests).

Let's head downstairs first, we'll then have a look at the back of the main room.

This is where I produce food (melons and potatoes are my only sources of food), sugar canes, and nether wart. Quite normal eh. There is however a secret beneath the planks : every of this goods gets picked up by an automated minecart (we will see in a minute where lies its destination).

Be noticed that I'd be pleased to answer any question about the redstone systems I used if any.  
Well, nothing more down here. Heading back upstairs ?

[![Some more chests](http://up.schoewilliam.fr/images/2013-11-21_21.01.07.png)](http://up.schoewilliam.fr/images/2013-11-21_21.01.07.png)

There we are at the very back of the main room. Two small functional rooms are set up. **On the left**, behind the portal that is on, is my brewing room (no fancy mechanism here, just some hoppers to be able to brew on the fly multiple successions of potions). **On the right** is the destination of that minecart I talked about : it drops everything it had picked up, so as the goods to be filtered each in a chest.

Feel at home my dear guest.

[![See you next time!](http://up.schoewilliam.fr/images/2013-11-21_22.06.16.png)](http://up.schoewilliam.fr/images/2013-11-21_22.06.16.png)

We still have a lot to see… the redstone parts, my neighbours places, the beautiful village, and so on… Allow me to say good bye on a wet path (rainy days are the prettiest ones, aren't they ?), and see you next time !
