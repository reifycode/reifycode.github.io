Just passing by to announce that I will be attending to the [Mozilla Summit 2013](http://summit.mozilla.org/) in Brussels, next October. I'll of course publish a series of posts and thoughts about the experience on this weblog :-D.

Needless to say that I am very excited, and that I had a great surprise when I got my invitation.  
*To anyone who will be attending too, see you there !*
