One small question… that I ask myself everyday. I feel like tired. And guess something ; I told myself the other day : *"What a shame to feel tired at seventeen…"*

Something really wrong gets over me each time that I hear about studies, society life, the future which I "have to think of". How am I supposed to dream?

Something really wrong gets over me once I realise that I am not standing the way I would like to, once I feel my pained feet trying to move. How am I supposed to dream?

I am not trying to be poetic, to write something beautiful, or to pretend that I am depressed. I am not yet. Right now, I am trying to figure out how such music could make me able to dream.

How am I supposed to dream if I keep feeling being the only one sitting there, and enjoying ?
