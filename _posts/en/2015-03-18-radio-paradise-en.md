*Today, I decided to support [an online radio](http://radioparadise.com) that I've been listening to for several months already. Here's me writing a small introduction, and sharing a project I enjoy every day.*

When I listen to music, I often just play my whole music library on shuffle mode, and let it run for hours. Whether it is in the background or I am actively listening to it. Not controlling which specific music I want to play allows me to endessly rediscover my library, which can only grow over time.

The idea behind *Radio Paradise* is to offer an Internet musical radio, without any commercial, and financially supported by its listeners.

The music played on air will certainly appeal to many people. Genres vary a lot. However, a very special attention is given to the way songs flow together so as to make sense "*harmonically, rhythmically, and lyrically*".

> "RP is a blend of many styles and genres of music, carefully selected and mixed by two real human beings."

The two people behind it work *full time* on Radio Paradise to manage it all, and to conceive cohesive playlists, without creating any too big of a gap between two tracks. And I must admit: they succeed admirably.  
It was partly with this idea in mind that I had tried to set up my own [personal webradio (fr)](/2013/08/02/music-schoewilliam-fr-r√©sultat-dune-heure-d-ennui.html) at the time.

I highly recommand it to you: [radioparadise.com](http://radioparadise.com).
