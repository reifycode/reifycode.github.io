*Just got back home from London at [Mozilla Festival 2014](http://2014.mozillafestival.org/) [and a little detour by Paris on the way back home]. It was really nice to meet some of my fellows from the Marketplace Team, and to enjoy with a lot of enthusiastic mozillians.  
Below are some photos from MozFest, and my little London Tour.*

## MozFest!
