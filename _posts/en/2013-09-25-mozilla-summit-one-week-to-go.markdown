As I [told earlier](/2013/09/04/heading-to-mozilla-summit-brussels.html), I'll be attending the Mozilla Summit 2013 in Brussels ! Very excited since it is only about days now until then.

I just updated my [Mozillians.org profile](https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/schoewilliam/) with contact informations for you other Mozillians, and a bit about how I am involved with Mozilla (have a look at my face too, if you want to meet me there).

Also to be noticed that I will be one of the demoers of Firefox OS (at the *demo carts*) on Saturday and Sunday of the Summit, hope to meet others who are as excited as I am about it ! :-D

*Photos, and posts coming !*
