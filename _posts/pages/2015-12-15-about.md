# Who are we ?

Hello earthlings, we are [reify](/2016/01/14/why-reify.html). We are basically a duo of Computer Science 
enthusiasts/programmers/students. Our interests include everything that comes under the [umbrella](http://giphy.com/gifs/funny-film-xyRNC33DiD172) of Computer Science and we hope to be able to explore as much of this world as we can. This blog is meant to be able to document the things that we have done and also to help us reach a much wider audience who may share the same interests as us. So lets go about introducing the members of team reify:

{% assign authors = site.data.authors %}

![Yup, that's me]({{ authors.shreyashpatodia.avatar }}){: class="avatar"} 

 {{ authors.shreyashpatodia.description }} [[More About Me Here!]](/shreyashpatodia)


![Yup, that's me]({{ authors.thepulkitagarwal.avatar }}){: class="avatar"} 

And {{ authors.thepulkitagarwal.description }} [[More About Me Here!]](/thepulkitagarwal)

So yeah that's us.
