Greetings everyone !! I hope you have been keeping well and enjoyed the New Year celebrations. As the new year brings new beginnings, we at Reify wanted to start off the blog in an attempt to document our crusades through the world of Computer Science. 

What I want to address in this piece is a combination of things, A quick introduction to the [Unity - Game Engine](https://unity3d.com/) and a quick walk-through the development process of a game that I built using Unity. 

If you don't already know about Unity, it is an awesome engine that allows you to develop multi-platform games. You can check out it's website [here](https://unity3d.com/). [_Note: The tutorials on the official website are awesome !!_]. You can use [CLI Languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_CLI_languages) like C#, Boo or Javascript(_which is not really a CLI Language but the version used by Unity is_) for the scripts in your game. Unity makes it very simple to add the animations, shapes, textures and audio that you need to make your game amazing. It is also possible to make non-game applications on Unity, although it is a total over-kill and would probalby lead to very battery-hungry applications. So if you are at all interested in game development, Unity is a godsend and you should definitely check it out. 

Moving on to the game I made(_I'm calling it 'Can you get there ??' for now_)is a very basic game wherein the user attempts to navigate through a maze, dodging enemies while battling against the clock in order to get home. I got the idea for the game from an [AwfulMedia](https://www.youtube.com/user/AwfulMedia) tutorial. The tutorials by AwfulMedia for this game use Unity version 4.x while the latest version for Unity at the time of writing of the article is 5.3, so it may be advisable to do the scripting yourself as there are a few syntactical differences between v4.0 and v5.0.I use C# for scripting purposes but using JS or Boo should not alter the difficulty of developing the game. What the game has:

+ Two complete levels.
+ A Main Menu to help navigate through thre game.
+ A world that allows for easy navigation to the levels and the main menu (_credits: [AwfulMedia](https://www.youtube.com/user/AwfulMedia)_) 

I think that's going to be all for my first post, attached below is a link to the resources of the game and my build for OS X. I hope you like it.
