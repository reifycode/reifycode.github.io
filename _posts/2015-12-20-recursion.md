Greetings everyone !! 

As the name of this category suggests this section is going to be about recursion. We feel really strongly abut recursion and it's ability to make our code a lot cleaner and shorter. We aim to be able to bring the foremost problems in Computer Science solved recursively and some where we try to give the problems a recursive spin(although it may not always be the most efficient way to do that particular problem). Our major hope for thi section is to convine our readers that 'Recursion is Beautiful'.
So watch this space for more. 

P.S I know the GIF is sick.
